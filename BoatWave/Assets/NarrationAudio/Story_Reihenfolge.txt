Hi Ben my Love,
it's Mary. Greetings from the pacific ocean, 6 miles under the sea level. The expedition is going well. We found the spot that is described in the legends and began to dive to the seabed. Sadly the floodlights stopped working ten minutes ago. The sonar waves are the only way to keep track of our surroundings.
But at least the recorder still works so I can tape this little diary for you. How is our little girl? I'm sorry I'll miss Emma's birthday. Tell her, mummy loves her!
Love you both so much.

I'm so excited. It took months of planing, gathering information, talking to boring people and collecting money. It was so exhausting. But we did it! Finally. There is an ancient city waiting to be discovered.

1.3. 
It's more work than I expected. Sitting in the dark, staring into the mud, hoping to discover a suspicious stone. Or brick. Or pillar. I don't know. I'm keeping my eyes open. I hope the legend is true.

2.
A rock crashed into us. The submarine is damaged, Matt is checking the impact. I hope there are no serious consequences. I need to focus on the environment. I can't see a damn thing down here.

3. 
Bad news... The oxygen tank took damage and we are constantly losing essential ressources. I hope there is enough air until we finish our mission. But don't worry – I think we have enough left. 

4./(5.)!
I can feel the loss of oxygen in the cabin. Got an annoying headache. Matt didn't come back ,yet. I hope he fixes the tank and we stop losing oxygen. I have to admit I'm a bit nervous. I know you can't hear me right now but feeling like talking to you is calming me down.

Level 2



5.
I constantly hear a dull knocking in my head. Or is it the door? I don't know... got no time. I need to focus on what's in front of us. Breathing gets heavier.

6.
I hear terrifying noises. Like  a screaming! They make me dizzy. The headache got worse. What kind of creatures are living here?  I hope this is over soon. 

7.
Where the hell is Matt? He should have been back by now. I can't go looking for him, because I have to keep the submarine on track. My hands started trembling. I hope he is fine.

8.
The screaming just won't stop. Still don't know where it comes from. It seems familiar somehow. Like I heard that voice before. I can't think straight. I'm getting tired and my head feels like its about to explode. 

Level 3

9.
The cave is changing. The walls have a different colour. They got red somehow. Where am I? Did I discover hell? Am I dead? This - not real.

10. I know where I heard the voice before. It was Matt's voice. When I realized that I hurried out of the cabin just to find him laying on the floor. He was not moving. He is dead. I could swear he was screaming just seconds ago but his body was already cold. My mind is playing tricks on me.  I'm scared.

11.
Today is Emma's birthday. Is she wearing her pink dress? I bet she does. She loves it. And I'm sitting here. Miles under the sea level, staring into the dark, hoping to find something that will make me famous and rich. I'm realizing I was already rich before. Because I have you two. 

12.
I'm finally convinced I'm in hell. I wanted to discover an ancient city... but hell? That's truely groundbreaking. First person to discover the location of hell. An honor I would gladly grant someone else. How should I describe hell? It's not just a location... it's more like a feeling. I'm still not sure if this is real or if I'm just hallucinating but I'm quite sure I'll never come home again. I'm tired and breathing is almost impossible.

13. Goodbye my love.
